What keyword does Swift use to mark the definition of a function? (Think like def in Python and function in JavaScript.)
	Func

How do you declare the type of value that a function returns?
	You declare it in the first line of the fuction with the arrow as seen here "func greet(person: String) -> String" it declares that it will return a string

How could you use argument labels to help clean up your code or make it more readable?
	It allows the arguments to be called similarly to a sentance, with "from" taking the place of hometown. it allows you to call "hometown" without actually writing "hometown"
